#### Specification Sheet

_Summary:_ We are making a webportal which will handle basic needs of Students, Instructors, and the Tripâ€™s Liason.  
Each will have their own Role-based permissions (what they can see and do on the website) which will vary slightly.  
* The `Liason` will be able to generate reports (ex. t-shirt size list/number per size), 
* `Instructor` will be able to post course material & and edit the calendar, etc, and 
* `Student` should be able to see their grades and post their weekend plans.  
* `All Roles` will be able to view full list of contact info, student weekend trip plans, access discussion board, etc.  For each of these 3 roles, we need Use Cases, User Stories, and possibly a spec document that just outlines the role as a whole.  We also need to develop a single db schema to store information for all of these roles in a central place.  And we need to figure out (and possibly mock up) the UI/UX for the website as a whole and each role.
